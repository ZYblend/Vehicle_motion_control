# Vehicle_motion_control

In this repo, I present my vehicle motion control designs based on two ground vehicles:
- Model characterization
- Sensor filtering and fusion
- Odometry
- Velocity control  ( MPC control, PID control, LQR control )
- Path-tracking control ( MPC control, PID control, LQR control )
- Lane following control ( experiement: vision-based)
